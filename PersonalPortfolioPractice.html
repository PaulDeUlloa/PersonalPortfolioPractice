                <h2>About Me:</h2>
                <p>Hello Everyone,</p>
                    <p>
                    I'm 26 years old and currently located in California. I have a background in Management and a 
                    Software Engineering basics for everyone certificate from edX. Im currently enrolled in Coding Dojo's Full-Time Full Stack Development
                    bootcamp. I'm excited to complete the bootcamp at the end of October so I can fully complete my new career in software 
                    development. I have a high level of expectations for myself and in my previous role I showed up each day putting my best foot forward.
                    I would enjoy doing the same at your company! I have sound interpersonal skills and have hosted multiple high level meetings with 
                    executives, leadership, peers, and most imortantly subortinates. Bringing value to your company would be my pleasure, so allow me to show you my value through my
                    porfolio. Thank you for your time, please enjoy.</p>
